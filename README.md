# Rock, Paper, Scissors
A basic rock, paper, scissors game from The Odin Project's curriculum.
This projects culminates my self-teaching journey through The Odin Project. This project resisists refactoring and updates in order to:

1. Demonstrate ability to learn independently and self-teach
2. Serve as contrast to progress made since enrolling with Turing School of Software and Design

## Pepto Bismol Pink Interface

I cringe at it now! But alas...I will not refactor this project.

## Clear Input Button

I had to write code to do this because I (for some reason) chose to make this a text-based game of rock, paper, scissors since at the time I was not aware of
event bubbling/delegation or how to add event listeners.

## Functioning RPS Game

Fortunately, the logic written for the game does result in a fully functioning product.
- Computer generates a random move on each button click
- Adds to score upon win
- First to reach 3 points is declared winner
